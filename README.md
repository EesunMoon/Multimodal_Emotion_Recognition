## üîç Project Summary

As part of a government agency project, I led the development of an **on-device multimodal emotion recognition system** on NPUs (Neural Processing Units). The project focused on optimizing real-time AI applications for **high emotion classification accuracy**, **low latency**, and **power efficiency**, addressing constraints typical of edge systems, such as limited model size and computational resources.

### Objectives
1. **Enhancing emotion recognition performance** by leveraging multimodal data sources, including:
   - Heart rate (HR)
   - EEG
   - Speech
   - Images

2. **Implementing a scalable real-time system** by embedding models on NPUs to reduce latency and power consumption.

### 1. Model Design and Optimization
- **Simplified Architectures**: Developed deep learning models using architectures like CNNs and dense layers to balance performance and complexity.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conducted ablation studies to fine-tune parameters such as optimizer type, number of epochs, batch size, and loss functions.
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Adopted a **score-based fusion method** to combine outputs from multiple models at the decision level, avoiding additional neural network complexity.

### 2. NPU Deployment
- Converted models into **ONNX format** and compiled them using the **MXQ compiler** for compatibility with Mobilint‚Äôs NPU chips.
- Applied **quantization techniques** (Max, Percentile, and Max-Percentile) to compress models, optimizing based on an efficiency metric combining:
  - Matrix: Accuracy-increase ratio x Compression ratio


## üìä Optimization Methods

### Multimodal Fusion and Simplified Models
- Built individual models for HR, EEG, speech, and image data.
- Focused on reducing model parameters while maintaining relative performance using simple architectures like CNN and dense layers.
- Used **score-based fusion** to integrate outputs without additional network complexity.

### Quantization Techniques
- Converted models into NPU-compatible formats via **ONNX** and the **MXQ compiler**.
- Applied three quantization methods to determine the best compression:
  - **MAX**: Clipping ranges based on minimum and maximum values.
  - **Percentile**: Clipping ranges based on top percentile values.
  - **Max-Percentile**: Clipping ranges based on the top percentile of maximum values.
